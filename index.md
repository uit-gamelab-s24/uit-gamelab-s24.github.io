## Course description

The GameLab seminar will again be given Spring 2024! It is a 10 credit course where you will design, develop, and launch your own game. You will learn and explore a combination of valuable topics such as programming, entrepreneurship, game design and development process.

Throughout the course we will have go through, and learn, the complete cycle of game development from idea to launch. The course is focused on launching a functioning end product that marries user experience and technology:

* **Design**: Create a game design with accompanied design document.  
* **Technology**: Make and reason the correct technology choices to create the designed game considering the constraints of time, resources, technical performance and user experience.   
* **Team**: Decide roles and share tasks and responsibilities across team based on suitable skillset and area of interest.  
* **Process**: Agree on process, milestones and approach to development.  
* **Development**: Implement end to end game features in a time and performance efficient manner with the goal of creating usable and fun experience for the player.  
* **Business**: Launch the game on the target platforms app store with a clear plan how and why the game will make money in the market.

## Administrative information

The course will be given as a master's level course. We may consider allowing especially motivated bachelor students to take the course.

Admission requirements, learning goals, exam information and other administrative information is [on the uit websites](https://uit.no/utdanning/emner/emne/822449/inf-3910-8). You can also find the course schedule / information about the rooms used for the lecture and group [on timeplan.uit.no](https://timeplan.uit.no/emne_timeplan.php?sem=24v&module=INF-3910-8-1#week=1-25).

## Staff and collaborators
* Lars Ailo Bongo <lars.ailo.bongo@uit.no> (responsible professor).
* Ernie Roby-Tomic (teaching assistant).
* Anders Sildnes (teaching assistant).
* Ismet Bachtiar (Tvibit).

## Project and evaluation

The course has a very practical and hands-on approach. The primary evaluation criteria is the successful completion and launch of a  game. It is equally important that the choices related to featureset, technologies and programming languages are consistent with the user experience and usage patterns of the game itself.

Technologies to be used are up for the students to decide.

In addition to being evaluated on the successful completion of the game you will be evaluated on the technical design and implementation within chosen technologies. From code patterns, architecture and implementation to database schema and client-werver communications. The evaluation is done in collaboration between representatives of the local game industry and the faculty itself.

For the grade the project counts 80% and a presentation of the project (20%).
